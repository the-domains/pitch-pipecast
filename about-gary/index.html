data-reactid="49"><p><strong>Early Life</strong>Gary grew up in Lubbock, TX as the only child of a hard working house painter and a loving housewife. They started putting musical instruments into his hands at the age of 3. At age 11, Gary began playing cello in the school orchestra. This led to a series of new educational opportunities. By the time he graduated <a href="http://www.plainsmen.org/" title="Monterey High School">Monterey High School</a>, Gary was comfortable on cello, guitar, mandolin, fiddle and banjo.</p><p><strong>College Life </strong><br>Because of his musical abilities, Gary received a scholarship from <a href="http://www.lcu.edu/" title="Lubbock Christian University">Lubbock Christian University</a> (which was still a College at the time). During his first year of college he was a member of a musical group called Hard Travelers, a traveling group whose purpose was to recruit students from across the country. During that first year, he performed over 70 concerts across the US.</p><p>Over the next four years, Gary took advantage of every musical opportunity available to him. He was a member of several different performing groups, including the Acappella Chorus, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Chamber Ensemble, his own “progressive country” band called Aspen, and a mixed contemporary vocal ensemble called <a href="http://www.lcu.edu/admissions/best-friends.html" title="Best Friends">Best Friends</a>. It was for the group Best Friends that Gary first began arranging music. Before his graduation in 1986, Gary had arranged over 30 songs for the vocal ensemble.</p><p><strong>Early Career</strong><br>During his last two summers in college, Gary worked as a musician in Ruidoso, NM for the <a href="http://www.flyingjranch.com/" title="Flying J Chuckwagon">Flying J Chuckwagon</a>. During these two seasons, Gary performed almost 200 concerts. From there, Gary moved to Crane, TX where he worked for the <a href="http://www.craneisd.com/css/home.htm" title="Crane ISD">Crane ISD</a> as the choir director for 7-12 grade.</p><p><strong>International Work</strong><br>In the summer of 1988, Gary moved to Tennessee and joined <a href="http://www.acappella.org/" title="Acappella Ministries">Acappella Ministries</a> as a member of the singing group Acappella. Gary served as Road Manager and tenor for the group for several years. Roles and voice parts changed over the years and by the year 2000, Gary had toured around the world and performed over 1400 concerts.</p><p>Gary would spend much of his non-touring time in the recording studio, both as performer and producer. By the time his touring days were over, he had recorded 11 albums under the name Acappella, performed on and/or produced more than 30 other albums, and achieved a triple platinum status on the sales of the Acappella Company catalog.</p><p>In 2000, Gary stepped into the role of President of The Acappella Company. For the next three years he was heavily involved in the marketing of the Acappella Company groups. Gary constructed several different successful marketing campaigns and worked as the webmaster and designer for the recording label and ministry web sites.</p><p><strong>Post-Acappella</strong><br>In 2003, Gary moved to Corpus Christi, TX where he worked as Worship Minister for Christ Family Fellowship. This position was the perfect combination for all of Gary’s abilities. At CFF, Gary led the worship team in both a capella and instrumental worship services, arranged music for both styles weekly, created multimedia content for use in worship, and produced a 13-episode small group bible study video series for the church.</p><p>During this time, he also began doing work for outside organizations. In 2004, Gary began arranging contemporary a capella music for the youth choir at Shiloh Road Church of Christ in Tyler, TX. He continues this today for their annual contest at LTC in Dallas.</p><p>Gary also began working as web designer for several different organizations, including Jerry &amp; Lynn Jones’ <a href="http://www.marriagematters.ws/" title="Marriage Matters">Marriage Matters</a> and <a href="http://yca-cc.org/Home.aspx" title="Yorktown Christian Academy">Yorktown Christian Academy</a>.</p><p><strong>Recent</strong><br>In 2009, Gary and his family moved to Shallowater, TX. He joined the “family business,” working for <a href="http://www.moyersgroup.com/" title="Moyers Group">Moyers Group</a> and <a href="http://www.studio84.com/" title="Studio 84">Studio84</a>. Gary wore several hats with the company. As V.P. of Client Development, he oversaw all marketing for the organization, including web development, online marketing and creation of direct mail pieces and print material (brochures, flyers, posters, etc). He did the same for their associated businesses: Studio84, <a href="http://www.skyviewhelicopters.net/" title="SkyView Helicopters">SkyView Helicopters</a> and <a href="http://www.wingspoint.org/" title="Wings Point Ministries">Wings Point Ministries</a>. In September of 2010, Gary became the CEO of a new venture, Moyers Online, Inc., which offered products from over 200 lines at discount prices.</p><p>In 2012, Gary operated <strong>Moyers Design. </strong>This was his own company which grew as the result of years of web design for the companies for which he has worked. Gary designed professional sites for many companies and organizations, including <a href="http://marriagematters.ws/">Marriage Matters</a>, <a href="http://llanoemmaus.org/">Llano Estacado Emmaus Community</a>, <a href="http://sbmaterials.com/">Sterling Business Materials</a>, <a href="http://slspartnership.com/">SLS Partnership</a>, <a href="http://brazoswest.com/">Brazos West</a>, <a href="http://liveonstage-pb.com/">Live on Stage Permian Basin</a> and many more.</p><p><strong>Current</strong><br>In October of 2014, Gary accepted a position with Broadway Church of Christ in Lubbock, TX as their new Worship and Technology Minister. Broadway is a church that has heavily invested into technology, and this alone keeps Gary pretty busy. Along with that, he oversees the worship ministry of the church, planning all corporate worship events, mentoring and training new worship leaders, rehearsals of all singers and musicians, and creation of new worship materials, e.g. videos, music, etc. And, of course, he is in charge of their website.
